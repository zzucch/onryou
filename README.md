# onryou

Audio normalization proxy server for ankiconnect.

## Status

This project is currently in its very early stage of development.

## Motivation

All of my anki cards contain two audio fields, which are filled by
[yomitan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan) and
[asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer) via
[ankiconnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/), and as the audio
sources can be very different from one card to another, the volume differences
quickly become very annoying.

(i've never actually tried using
[this addon](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2123044452), it might solve
the problem for somebody looking for the solution on desktop only, but since
i do all my reviews on mobile, it wouldn't be of any help to me personally)

Naming the project 'onryou seikika' (音量正規化 audio normalization) is
kinda silly, therefore it is just onryou (volume).
